# Fastq2LoxDel

Scripts used to extract lox-derived deletions.

The example described here allows to reproduce the results observed in 'LoxTnSeq: Transposon mutagenesis coupled with ultra sequencing to study large random genome reductions' by Daniel Shaw *et al.* (to be published).

# Example

- Locate all fastq files in the same directory with the scripts from this repository.

- Run peFastq2LoxDel.py:

```{python}
python3 peFastq2LoxDel.py
```
